# Sense

My personal project/repo as I am learning:
1. Computer Vision
2. SLAM
3. LiDAR based SLAM
4. Point cloud processing
5. OpenGL as a by product of the first 4

## Readme's
[CV](docs/cv.md)

## Visualization/OpenGL

I wanted to rapidly expirement, visualize, validate, etc... To do this I wanted the algorithm development tightly linked with the visualization (results). I decided to use OpenGL for this.
